# Hi, I'm Fernando Carrillo 👋

**Backend Developer – Python · FastAPI · PostgreSQL · Docker**

I design and build backend services and REST APIs, with a strong focus on clean architecture, testing and maintainability. I’m currently working on a Geo Information Center (GIC) platform that plans and processes drone flight missions for geospatial analysis using AI models.

## 🧩 About me

- Backend developer based in the Canary Islands (Spain).
- Currently working on microservices for drone mission planning, geospatial data processing and AI-powered products (suspicious activity detection, wildfire prevention, biodiversity analysis, etc.).
- Strong focus on:
  - Clean, layered architectures
  - Test-driven development mindset (pytest)
  - Database design and migrations (SQLModel + Alembic, PostgreSQL)
  - Authentication & authorization (Authentik, OAuth/OpenID-style flows)
- I enjoy taking ownership from design to deployment: modeling the domain, defining API contracts, implementing well-tested services and improving performance when something is slow or fragile.

> 💬 I speak **English** and **Spanish**, so feel free to reach out in either language.

## 📌 Highlighted projects

Here are some repositories that represent how I like to build backend services:

- [**fastlayers**](https://github.com/fernandoc-dev/fastlayers)  
  Template for building FastAPI-based APIs using a layered architecture (routes → services → repositories → models), with a focus on maintainability and clear separation of concerns.

- [**fastgen**](https://github.com/fernandoc-dev/fastgen)  
  CLI tool to quickly generate structured FastAPI projects with Docker integration, database support (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL), API versioning and optional extras like Alembic.

- [**mqtt-message-emitter**](https://github.com/fernandoc-dev/mqtt-message-emitter)  
  Lightweight, scenario-driven tool for publishing synthetic MQTT messages at precise rates. Separates a reusable framework (venv lifecycle, runner, profiling) from pluggable “scenarios”.

- [**swingstat**](https://github.com/fernandoc-dev/swingstat)  
  Ongoing project to analyze the performance of amateur baseball players. Combines data modeling, statistics and API design.

- [**algorithms**](https://github.com/fernandoc-dev/algorithms)  
  Exercises and notes focused on improving problem-solving skills in Python.

> I’m gradually cleaning up and documenting older repositories so they reflect better how I work today.

## 🤝 How I like to work

- Prefer **clean, explicit code** over clever tricks.
- Aim for **small, composable services** with clear boundaries.
- Write **tests that matter**, not just to increase a coverage number.
- Care a lot about **developer experience** (make it easy for others to run, test and extend the code).
- Document APIs using **OpenAPI** and keep code and documentation in sync.
